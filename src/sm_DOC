---------------------------------------

Overall Design:
 
  This is an implemenation of the system catalogs as relations within
  the database along with commands required to bootstrap and interact
  with tables/indexes in the database. 

   relcat and attrcat are built as RM files with fixed schemas.
   A struct called DataRelInfo was created (much like DataAttrInfo) to
   represent each record in relcat. Each record in attrcat is
   basically a DataAttrInfo struct.

---------------------------------------

Key Data Structures:

  
   The items maintained in relcat include -

recordSize;            // Size per row
attrCount;             // # of attributes
numPages;              // # of pages used by relation
numRecords;            // # of records in relation
relName[MAXNAME+1];    // Relation name

   Currently numPages and numRecords are populated by
   SM_Manager::Load() but other DML will also have to keep these
   correct in order for them to be useful system statistics.
    
---------------------------------------

Testing:

   Automated unit tests were used to test each class. A popular test
   harness - google-test, which is in the
   same style as JUnit was used to make testing fast and automatic.
   See sm_manager_gtest.cc.
   Data files were created and used for testing alongside testing with
   the suggested stars/soaps data.

---------------------------------------

Bugs/Known Issues:
    
   Wish there was a way to print the index as if it were a
   relation. I considered making the index available as a full
   relation by making entries in relcat/attrcat but decided against it
   so that users would not be stopped from creating tables with
   .number suffixes.
